## the transistor
- logically, each trans acts as a switch
- combined to implement logic func (&, or, !) and to build higher-level structures


## MOS transistors
- an electronic switch that is open or closed between the source and the drain depending on the voltage on the gate
- MOS = Metal oxide semiconductor
 - two types: n-type and p-type


## Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Transistors
