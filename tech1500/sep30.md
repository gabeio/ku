## Line Coding
is the process of converting dig data as bits to dig signals
at the sender, dig data 

## Unipolar
Unipolar schemes have signal levels all on same side of t-axis (abv or blw)
(1/2)(V^2)+(1/2)(0)^2=(1/2)(V)^2

polar schemes: voltages on both sides of t-axis
nrz-l:level of the voltage determines the val of the bit
nrz-i:inversion or lack thereof determines the val of the bits
main problem with nrz:lack of sync

a system is using nrz-i to transfer 1mbps of data. what are the ave signal rate and minimum bandwidth?

## Pulse Coding Modulation PCM
most common technique to change an analog signal to digital data is called pulse code modulation
1. analog signal is sampled (SAMPLE)
2. sampled signal is quantized (QUANTIZE)(takeing the sample signal and making it into various levels)
3. quantized values encoded as streams of bits (ENCODING)

the analog signal is sampled every Ts second (sample intercal/period) or at frequency fs = 1/Ts called sampling rate.
