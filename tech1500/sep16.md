# data & signals
consider a scenario in which a scientist working in a company needs to order a book from an online bookseller

## analog and digital data
data can be analog or digital
- analog data refers to info that is continuous
- digital refers to info that has discrete states.

## comparison of signals
- analog signal has infinitely many levels of intensity over a period of time. as the wave moves from val a to b it passes through and includes an infinite number of falls along its path
- digital signals can have only a limited number of defined values; each val can be any number but it is often as simple as 1 & 0

## periodic and non-periodic
- a periodic signal completes a pattern w/in a measurable time frame, called a period, and repeats that pattern over a subsequent identical periods.
- the completion of one full pattern is called a cycle
- a non

## periodic analog signals
- periodic analog signals can be classified as simple or composite:
 - a simple periodic analog signal (a sine wave) cannot be decomposed into simpler signals
 - a composite periodic analog signal is composed of multiple sine waves

## sine wave
- the sine wave is the most fundamental form of a periodic analog signal. when we visualize it as a simple oscillating curve, its change over the course of a cycle is smooth and consistent, a continuous, rolling flow. each cycle consists of a single arc above the time axis followed by a single arc below it.

- peak amplitude: absolute value of high intensity

- period, T: how many seconds it takes a signal to complete a cycle
- freq, f: number of periods per second

6 periods in 1s is 6hz (hz=periods/s)

f=1/T; T=1/f
