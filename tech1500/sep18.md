## Composite Signals
- a composite signal is require to comm data
- any composite signal can be written as a combination of simple sine waves with diff freq amps and phases
- a composite signal can be periodic or nonperiodic

## Bit Rate
- most digital signals are nonperiodic
- we use bit rate (instead of freq) to describe digital signals
- the bit rate is the num of bits sent in 1s, expressed in bits per second(bps)
