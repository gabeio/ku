## Outline
1.1 Data Comm
1.2 Networks
1.3 Network Types
1.4 Internet history
1.5 standards and administration

## Objective
- data comm
- data exchange
- networks
- criteria structures
- network geometries
- types of networks
- LAN(local area network)
- WAN(wide area network)
- Internet(world)
- internet(smaller areas)
- history(blah blah blah #yawn)
 - originally just a test
 - advanced to being the world
- standards
- standard organization
- standard administration (guidelines) (acronyms)

## Data Comm
when we comm we are charing info this sharing can be local or remote
telecomm which include telephone, graph vision means comm at a distance
data comm are exchange of data between 2 devices via some form of transmission media

## Components
1. message (what)
2. sender (node)
3. receiver (node)
4. transmission medium (physical/wifi/cable/dialup)
5. protocol (rules)

## Data rep
text (bit pattern)
numbers (bit pattern)
images (bit pattern as pixels)
audio (continuous)
video (continuous and/or discrete)

## Data Flow
comm between 2 devices can be simplex half-duplex and full-duplex
- simplex=1direction
- half-duplex=2directional but one at a time
- full-duplex=2directional at the same time

## Networks
a network is the interconnection of a set of devices capable of comm
a dev can be a host, desktop,laptop,workstation,cellphone,security system
a dev in this definition can also be a connecting dev such as a router (connects 2 networks), a switch (connects devices), a modem(changes form of data) etc.

## Network Criteria
networks must be able to meet a certain number of criteria most important:
- performance: throughput and delay
- reliability: frequency of fail, time it takes to recover, robustness
- security: protection from unauthorized access, damage, recovery

## Physical Structures
network is 2+ devices connecting through links, comm pathways that transfer data between devices
two possible types: point to point, multipoint

## Types of conns
point 2 point (only 2 devices(from 1 to 1))
multipoint (from 1 to many)
- mesh (many computers are connected point to point)
- star (many computers are connected multipoint)
- bus (multipoint (signal weakening))
- ring (multipoint unidirectional)

## Network Types
criteria:
- size
- geo coverage
- ownership

## LAN (local area network)
- usually private
- connects some hosts to an office, building, campus
- hosts have to have an id (ip)
- packets need both receiver and sender address
isolated lans:
- common cable (bus) (past)
- hub (star) (today)

## WAN (wide area network)
a connection of devices capable of comm. however there are diffs between lan and wan. aln is normally limited in size; wan has a wider geo span(town state etc)
connects:
- switches
- routers
- modems
- usually leased & run by comm companies

### Point to Point Wan
one dedicated connection between wans

### Switched Wan
ring/switch network

### Heterogeneous network made of wan&lan
a intermingling of lans and wans...

## Switching
an internet is a switched network in which a switch connects at least 2 links
switch needs to forward data from a network to another network when req
2 most comm types of switched networks are circuit switched and packet switched networks

### circuit switched network
ex: old telephone with operators

### packet switched network
a queue that holds the packets and sends when available from the many sources via routers

## The Internet
an internet is 2+ networks that can communicate with each other
- ISP: internet service provider
- backbone: large networks owned by big corps (At&t Sprint Verizon (international ISPs))
- peering points: connect networks; consist of complex switches
- provider networks: use backbone services for fee (national/regional ISP)
- customer networks pay fees to provider networks

## Accessing the Internet
the internet today is an internetwork that allows any user to become part of it
the user however needs to be physically connected to an ISP
the physical conn is normally done through a point to point

telephone:
- dialup
- dsl(digital subscriber line)
cable
wireless networks
direct connections (become a local ISP)

## Internet Hist
(non-crucial)
- birth of the internet 1972
- ARPANET (origin)
- Cerf & Kahn

## Standards & Admin
standards are thoroughly tested by specification
and must be adhered to
draft > experimental/informational > etc.
(originally an experiment)
