#Statistics:
it is a science of data analysis that provides the methodology for manipulation of research topic, collection of data, organization of data, analysis of data, interpretation of data analysis, hypothesis testing and making conclusions about a *population* based on info obtained from a *sample*.

###Population:
a collection of data about a research topic

###Sample:
a subset of population we have different types of sample
a representative sample data collected from a population without bias

EX: Random Sample: Stratified Sampling Technique

    | W  | S  | AA | O  |(Stratas)
----|----|----|----|----|----  
Male|20% |10% |10% |05% |6000  
----|----|----|----|----|----  
Fmal|30% |10% |10% |05% |9000  
----|----|----|----|----|----  
    |7000|4000|4000| ?? |15000  

##Systematic Sampling:
standing in-front of shop-rite and sampling all/some of the humans walking in.

##Cluster Sampling
ex: sampling stratified sampling from only some of the strata

##Sources of Data
- Survey
- Published Reports
- Experiments
- Internet

###Variable:
Characteristics of interest whose values vary from subject to subject
ex: eyecolor, haircolor, blood type, type of major
