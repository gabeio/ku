## Total Probability
table:
[
a1:[],
a2:[],
a3:[],
...,
ak-1:[],
ak:[]
]

consider events a1,a2...ak be non overlapping (mutually exclusive events.) (drawing 2 cards from a deck...)

B=(AUB)

the multiplication rule is obtains from the definition of conditional probability by cross multiplying...
( P(A|B) )/( 1 )*( P(A intersection B) )/( P(A) )
